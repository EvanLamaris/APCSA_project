# APCSA_project
My attempt at creating MINESWEEPER:

The project is a recreation of minesweeper with my abilities, minesweeper is a simple single player game in which the player has to filler out the mines and complete the given grid. In the version I created, they could either left-click a square in a grid to reveal the number of mines adjacent mines or right-click to flag a potential mine. If the player accidentally reveals a mine, it is game over, and if the player successfully filters out all the mines, they win. While completing this task there is also a timer running in the backround so they have to complete the grid within the given time. I used python to complete this task. 

The motivation and the reason of this minesweeper project was to create a playable game that anyone could enjoy while completing the task of doing a final project. I learned how to create a timer and more effeciently use tkinter. 
"Features":
- Has a timer, running from 100 seconds downwards
- a reset button that resets the mines and the board
- a reveal button that reveals all the current mines
- flag handing, can place and remove flags on squares at will
- messages, either a 'congratulations" or "game over" message will show depending on the outcome of the game
- board, creates a board with mines and squares with numbers

Thank you for readin this far :D
